The `asylum` package provides easy access to asylum and resettlement
datasets for the UK, published by the Home Office.

The current release uses the most recent data from June 2023.

## Installation

Install the released version of `asylum` from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=asylum):

``` r
install.packages("asylum")
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("humaniverse/asylum")
```

## Example

To calculate the number of applications from Afghanistan awaiting a
decision, as of the latest quarter:

``` r
library(asylum)
library(dplyr)
#> Warning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.2.3
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'dplyr'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     filter, lag
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

asylum::awaiting_decision |> 
  filter(Nationality == "Afghanistan" & Date == max(Date)) |> 
  summarise(`Total applications awaiting a decision` = sum(Applications))
#> # A tibble: 1 × 1
#>   `Total applications awaiting a decision`
#>                                      <dbl>
#> 1                                    15098
